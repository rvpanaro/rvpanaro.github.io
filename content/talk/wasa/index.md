abstract: <p align="justify"> This study aims to show a reliable framework for semiparametric survival regression proposed by Osman & Ghosh [2012] which includes Proportional Hazards (PH) for right censored data based on fullyMaximum Likelihood (ML) estimation. Along with regression estimates, this approach also provides a nonparametric shape for thebaseline risk based on Bernstein Polynomials (BP) that enables smooth estimates for the baseline risk and baseline cumulative risk. A dataset was generated from a Weibull PH (WeibullPH) model using the inverse transform method in order to make a comparison between semiparametric Cox’s PH model (CoxPH), parametric Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model and semiparametric BP based PH (BPPH) model, regarding the Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of the estimates and the Integrated Squared Error (ISE) of the estimated survivor curves to evaluate the overall performance in three differing scenarios, all calculations were made using the R software.  </p>
