Along with regression estimates, this approach also provides a nonparametric shape for thebaseline risk based on Bernstein Polynomials (BP) that enables smooth estimates for the baseline risk and baseline cumulative risk. A dataset was generated from a Weibull PH (WeibullPH) model using the inverse transform method in order to make a comparison between semiparametric Cox’s PH model (CoxPH), parametric Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model and semiparametric BP based PH (BPPH) model, regarding the Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of the estimates and the Integrated Squared Error (ISE) of the estimated survivor curves to evaluate the overall performance in three differing scenarios, all calculations were made using the R software.

The continuous monitoring is performed by ANEEL in accordance with Technical Note 111/2016 (June 29, 2016) in order to prevent the degradation of the regulated service and identify any issues in energy distribution administration. In this sense, a quarterly report namely Relatório de Indicadores de Sustentabilidade Econômico-Financeira das Distribuidoras comprises 11 indicators divided into 6 subareas debt, efficiency, investments, profitability, shareholder return and operating from 2011 to 2017. The objective of this paper is to quantify the indebtedness level of companies in the tensor structured data (company x indicator x year) provided by those reports. For this, tree-based, linear and polynomial regression models were fitted in which feature variables originated from dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis and Autoencoder. Also, a Bayesian Structural Equation Model simultaneously promoting Confirmatory Factor Analysis (outer model) and incorporating linear relationships (inner model) between latent variables was fitted. The performance comparison of these methods was made from the predictive power in the validation set.\n","tags":["Autoencoder","Principal Component Analysis Regression","Structural Equation Models","Bayesian Inference","Regression tree"],"title":"Predictive modeling of economic and financial monitoring of The Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567712700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567712700,"objectID":"f92615deb022dc5d8a06e0fa3eb66cdc","permalink":"/talk/este/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/este/","section":"talk","summary":"Identificação de padrões e tendências presentes na economia do Brasil por meio de modelos preditivos.","tags":["SARIMA","Dynamic Linear Model","Box-Jenkins","Time Series","IPCA","inflation"],"title":"Modelagem e Previsão da Inflação Anual Efetiva medida pelo IPCA","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567398069,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"/about/","publishdate":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567398069,"objectID":"e992907bc94a2c6bd63a1fab46926dad","permalink":"/work/","publishdate":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/work/","section":"","summary":"Aqui está o nosso time de escritores!","tags":null,"title":"Work","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558611000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567398069,"objectID":"dc4a30a223deb4b2c7872fa7c9540251","permalink":"/talk/ensemble/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ensemble/","section":"talk","summary":"Uma Abordagem Não Paramétrica Aplicada à Detecção de Diabetes.","tags":["ensemble","Machine Learning","classification"],"title":"CLASSIFICADOR ENSEMBLE","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558611000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567398069,"objectID":"0321d0bbed7593c58bf732e76b5ca47a","permalink":"/talk/spsurv/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/spsurv/","section":"talk","summary":"A Bernstein Polynomial application in Survival Analysis.","tags":["survival","Rstan","bernstein polynomial"],"title":"SEMIPARAMETRIC SURVIVAL ANALYSIS VIA BERNSTEIN POLYNOMIALS","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558600200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567398069,"objectID":"3f00b6f49c2098c4612eefd0cc9f7e1b","permalink":"/talk/segmented/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/segmented/","section":"talk","summary":"An Application to Exercise Physiology Data.","tags":["piecewise regression","Rstan","segmented"],"title":"CHANGE POINT ESTIMATION IN SEGMENTED REGRESSION MODEL USING RSTAN","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551344400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551344400,"objectID":"6dfa3bad5b53edd9435528a1fcf9be18","permalink":"/talk/dsufrj/","publishdate":"2019-02-28T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/dsufrj/","section":"talk","summary":"Previsão do consumo de energia elétrica desagregado por classes.","tags":["Dynamic Linear Model","Energy Market"],"title":"Previsão do consumo de energia elétrica via Modelos Dinâmicos","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;
